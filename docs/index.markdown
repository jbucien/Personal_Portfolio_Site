title: Hello!

I'm a technical writer who specializes in software documentation.

I'm currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science at Oregon State University. After graduation, I will join the Content & Communications Experience team at Salesforce. I enjoyed my experience last summer as a Salesforce technical writing intern, so I'm grateful that I have the opportunity to return to such a great team.

I also hold a BA in Asian & Middle Eastern Cultures from Barnard College (2019). Prior to pivoting to technical communication, I worked at a luxury travel agency in NYC (specializing in trips to Asia of course). In my spare time, I enjoy cuddling with my dog, playing cozy games, and learning to cook.
