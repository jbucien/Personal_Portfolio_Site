## Hello!

I am a technical writer who specializes in software documentation.

I am pursuing a second bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Oregon State University. I am excited to join the Content & Communications Experience team at Salesforce upon graduation.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking and walking Happy, my energetic mini poodle mix.
