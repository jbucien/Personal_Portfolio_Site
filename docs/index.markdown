I'm a technical writer who specializes in software documentation. I currently work for the Content Experience (CX) team at Salesforce. I maintain the developer documentation for legacy products, such as Visualforce and Lightning Aura Components. I also worked on the pilot documentation for Prompt Builder. Other ongoing projects include work for the Instrumentation and Embedded Component Services scrum teams.

I hold a BS in Computer Science from Oregon State University (2023). I also hold a BA in Asian & Middle Eastern Cultures from Barnard College (2019). Prior to pivoting to technical communication, I worked at a luxury travel agency in NYC. In my spare time, I enjoy cuddling with my dog, playing cozy games, and learning to cook.
