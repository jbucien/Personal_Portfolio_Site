## Publishing Toolchain Article
My Salesforce internship (Summer 2022) project. The article explains the conceptual differences between the Perforce and Git/GitHub publishing toolchains. It specifically targets documentation teams who are transitioning from using a centralized version control system to a distributed version control system.

## Python Tutorial
A written adaptation of the web scraping project in Colt Steele’s Udemy video course The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp. Designed for intermediate Python learners, the tutorial briefly introduces the concept of web scraping before outlining the project objectives. The tutorial includes inline Python code snippets and annotated screenshots that allow learners to easily visualize how to execute each step. The last page of the tutorial also has challenge project ideas and additional resources to extend learners’ curiosity.
